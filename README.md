This App is Tab view based app for an electric vehicle showroom.

You can dispay your products with dynamic cards. These cards have more info in them once you click on them which is similar to AirBNB Homepage.

User can book any particular model inside the card itself with a specific booking amount respective of that particular vehicle model and for payment i have integrated apple pay option as of now.

The home tab also has a search and filter bar that can be used to filter out specific products and their prices based on a few user input filters.

The 2nd tab is a grid like card view displaying spare parts and their prices.

You can add spare parts to your cart by simply clicking on the + icon .

Your cart is simply a collection of all your added spare parts below which there is a total amount and apple pay option.

Now the 3rd tab is for chatting with the dealership for any customer concern regarding products or spare parts. To achieve this i have used Firebase databse and linked it to the Chat View.

The last tab is a profile section which is still under development.
